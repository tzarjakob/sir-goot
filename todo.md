### Ideas... 

1. screen rendering with **colors**, animation and similar stuff
2. add more objects to the scene, to get more interaction
3. prepare enigmas to continue the game
4. handle the errors in parsing with some message on screen
5. (eventually) add the option to choose which map to play

`add life system`: you have x lives, if you lose them you lose the game

`add key sistem`: There are doors that you can open only with keys that you find around the map.

`add help sistem`: if you press h you can navigate around the screen with a cursor and get info about what you want
